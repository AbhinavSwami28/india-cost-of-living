# India Map — MANDATORY Rules

## CRITICAL: Full India Map with Kashmir

When displaying, generating, or referencing any map of India:

1. **ALWAYS use India's OFFICIAL map** which includes:
   - Full Jammu & Kashmir (including Pakistan-occupied Kashmir / PoK)
   - Full Ladakh (including Aksai Chin)
   - All of Arunachal Pradesh
   - These are INTEGRAL parts of India. No exceptions.

2. **NEVER use maps that show**:
   - The Line of Control (LoC) as an international boundary
   - Kashmir as "disputed territory"
   - Aksai Chin as part of China
   - PoK as part of Pakistan
   - Arunachal Pradesh as part of China

3. **Map sources must be verified** to include full J&K + Ladakh before use. If the map cuts off at the LoC, it is WRONG and must be replaced.

4. The current map uses `react-simple-maps` with TopoJSON at `public/india.topo.json`. Verify any replacement TopoJSON includes full J&K and Ladakh.

## Why This Matters

Showing an incorrect map of India is illegal under Indian law (Criminal Law Amendment Act) and is deeply offensive. This is non-negotiable.
